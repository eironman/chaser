Chaser
======

Simple javascript game using create.js

You must avoid the chaser eating your mouse inside a boundaries.
If it catches you or you're out of bounds you lose.


Features
=========

- Avoids the chaser out of bounds.
- Control the last known mouse position to move the chaser even when the mouse stops.
- The chaser has a constant chasing speed, to avoid accelerating far from the cursor and decelerating close to it.
- Speed increases as time passes.
- Time score.

New Features
============
I would suggest:

- Adding a score by catching small objects that appear randomly during a limited time.
- Make other objects appear randomly and if you touch them you lose.
- Make it scroll so you have to escape heading a direction, and objects to intercept you appear in the opposite direction.

No license. Do whatever you want with it. If you win millions, please don't forget me :)
